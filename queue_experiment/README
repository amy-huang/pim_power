experiment configuration: 

- range of keys: 1-1000
- initial queue size: 524288 (this is to match the queue size of host queue implementation. In the host queue experiments, we needed 524288 nodes to make initial queue size 4MB -- twice the size of L2 cache).
- total number of operations: 786432 (= 524288/2 * 3.  This was chosen in order to make deq operations eventually deq from newly enqed nodes.)
- 50% enq, 50% deq
- 8 partitions; each partition used a 1MB segment. At any point in time, only two partitions are active. (partitions -- in particular, the pim cores -- containing nodes unnecessary at the point in time are put to sleep.)


timestamp2 contains results for 2-thread experiments, 
timestamp4 contains results for 4-thread experiments, 
timestamp6 contains results for 6-thread experiments, 
timestamp8 contains results for 8-thread experiments.
