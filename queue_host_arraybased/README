experiment configuration: 

- range of keys: 1-1000
- initial queue size: 524288 
- total number of operations: 786432 (= 524288/2 * 3.  This was chosen in order to make deq operations eventually deq from newly enqed nodes.)
- 50% enq, 50% deq


timestamp2 contains results for 2-thread experiments, 
timestamp4 contains results for 4-thread experiments, 
timestamp6 contains results for 6-thread experiments, 
timestamp8 contains results for 8-thread experiments.
